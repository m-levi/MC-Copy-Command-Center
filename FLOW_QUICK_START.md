Review the outline and ask for changes if needed.

### Step 4: Approve the Outline

When you're happy with the outline, just say:

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific in Your Initial Request
**Good**: "Create abandoned cart for luxury watches $1000-5000, no discount, elegant tone"  
**Better**: "Create abandoned cart for luxury watches. Price range $1000-5000. No discounts - emphasize craftsmanship and exclusivity. Elegant, refined tone."

### 2. Review the Outline Carefully
- Check timing makes sense for your business
- Verify tone matches your brand
- Ensure key points align with your strategy
- Request changes before approving

### 3. Iterate on the Outline
Don't approve the first version if it's not perfect! Say things like:
- "Can we add a 4th email?"
- "Make email 2 focus more on benefits"
- "Change timing to 2 hours, then 48 hours, then 96 hours"

### 4. Edit Individual Emails Freely
Each email is in its own conversation, so you can:
- Regenerate the entire email
- Tweak specific sections
- Adjust tone
- Add/remove elements
- Test variations
