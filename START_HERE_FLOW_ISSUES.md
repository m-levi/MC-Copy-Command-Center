# ⚠️ START HERE: Fixing Flow Issues

**Status**: Issues identified and ready to fix  
**Time to Fix**: ~15 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Easy (just run SQL migration)

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**What's wrong**: Database doesn't have flow columns  
**Why it's wrong**: Migration wasn't applied  
**How to fix**: Run one SQL script  
**Result**: Everything will work perfectly

---

## ✅ Step 1: Diagnose (2 minutes)

Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run this:

```sql
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'conversations' 
AND column_name = 'is_flow';
```

### Results:

**If you see 1 row** → ✅ Database is OK, issue is elsewhere (tell me!)

**If you see 0 rows** → ❌ Database missing columns (continue to Step 2)

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Apply Migration (5 minutes)

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Open file in your project: `FLOW_DATABASE_MIGRATION.sql`
3. Copy **entire file contents**
4. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"** button
6. Wait for success message: `✅ FLOW FEATURE MIGRATION COMPLETE`

**Done!** The database now has all flow columns.

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Verify (2 minutes)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'conversations' 
AND column_name IN ('is_flow', 'parent_conversation_id', 'flow_type', 'flow_sequence_order', 'flow_email_title');
```

**Expected**: 5 rows returned

**If you see 5 rows** → ✅ Migration successful!  
**If you see 0 rows** → ❌ Migration failed (tell me the error)

---

## 🔄 Step 4: Restart App (2 minutes)

```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

Then in browser:
- **Hard refresh**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

---

## 🎉 Step 5: Test Flow Feature (5 minutes)

1. **Create a Flow**:
   - Open any brand's chat
   - Click email type dropdown
   - Select "Flow"
   - Choose any type (e.g., "Abandoned Cart")

2. **Build Outline**:
   - Chat with AI about your flow
   - Say "approved" when ready
   - Click blue "Approve Outline" button

3. **Check Sidebar**:
   - Find your flow conversation
   - Look for arrow button (▶) next to flow type
   - Click arrow → should expand showing emails
   - Click an email → should open that email

**If all works** → ✅ You're done! Feature is working!

**If something doesn't work** → Tell me what you see

---

## 🔍 Quick Diagnostic (If Issues Persist)

Open browser console (F12) and look for these logs when creating a flow:

✅ **GOOD**:
```
[Flow] Created conversation: {is_flow: true, flow_type: "abandoned_cart"}
[ConversationCard] Flow conversation rendered: {is_flow: true}
```

❌ **BAD**:
```
[Flow] Created conversation: {is_flow: undefined}
[ConversationCard] Flow conversation rendered: {is_flow: undefined}
```

If you see `undefined` → Migration didn't apply correctly
