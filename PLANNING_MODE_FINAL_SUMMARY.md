# Planning Mode - Complete Redesign Summary

## Your Requirements

You wanted Planning Mode to:
1. âœ… **Not generate email copy** during planning
2. âœ… **Feel like a step-by-step process** when planning
3. âœ… **Be flexible** - support general questions and exploration, not just rigid planning
4. âœ… **Understand context** - adapt to what the user is trying to do
5. âœ… **Pass to next stage** when ready to write email

## What Was Built

### Phase 1: Separation of Planning vs. Email Copy

**Problem**: AI would generate email copy when users wanted to plan

**Solution**: 
- Created distinct system prompts for Planning Mode vs. Email Copy Mode
- Planning Mode AI now acts as strategist/consultant (asks questions, creates outlines)
- Email Copy Mode AI acts as copywriter (generates finished copy)
- Mode passed to API with every request

**Files**:
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Added `buildPlanningPrompt()`, separate from email prompt

### Phase 2: Visual Progress for Planning

**Problem**: Planning didn't feel like a process with stages

**Solution**:
- Created `PlanningStageIndicator` component showing 3 stages:
  - Discovery (understanding goals, audience)
  - Strategy (building outline, approach)
  - Ready (plan complete, ready to generate)
- Visual progress bar, stage icons, stage-specific hints
- Only shows when actual email planning detected

**Files**:
- `components/PlanningStageIndicator.tsx` (new component)
- `app/brands/[brandId]/chat/page.tsx` - Integrated component

### Phase 3: Improved Context Transfer

**Problem**: Context lost when moving from planning to email generation

**Solution**:
- Captures ENTIRE planning conversation (all messages)
- Creates comprehensive brief with full context
- Pre-fills input in Email Copy mode for review
- User can edit before sending

**Files**:
- `app/brands/[brandId]/chat/page.tsx` - Updated `handleTransferPlanToEmail()`

### Phase 4: Flexible Conversation Support

**Problem**: Too rigid - only worked for structured email planning

**Solution**:
- Updated AI prompt to support:
  - General questions & learning
  - Exploration & discovery
  - Campaign planning & brainstorming
- AI adapts response style to user intent
- Stage indicator only shows when email planning detected
- Conversational and natural for Q&A

**Files**:
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Completely rewrote `buildPlanningPrompt()`
- `components/PlanningStageIndicator.tsx` - Added smart detection
- `app/brands/[brandId]/chat/page.tsx` - Updated empty state
- `components/ChatInput.tsx` - Updated placeholder

## How It Works Now

### Scenario A: Asking Questions
```
User: "What makes a good subject line?"

AI: [Answers conversationally, provides tips and examples]

UI: No stage indicator (just conversation)
```

### Scenario B: Exploring Brand/Products
```
User: "Tell me about our target audience"

AI: [Analyzes brand info, discusses audience insights]

UI: No stage indicator (exploratory discussion)
```

### Scenario C: Planning Email Campaign
```
User: "I want to create a promotional email for our sale"

AI: [Asks strategic questions about audience, offer, goals]

UI: Stage indicator appears showing "Discovery" phase

[Conversation continues through Strategy stage]

AI: [Builds outline, suggests approaches]

UI: Stage indicator shows "Strategy" (50% progress)

[After planning complete]

AI: [Summarizes plan, suggests ready to generate]

UI: Stage indicator shows "Ready" âœ“ (100% progress)
    "Transfer Plan" button appears

User: [Clicks Transfer Plan]

UI: Switches to Email Copy mode
    Input pre-filled with full plan context

User: [Reviews and sends]

AI: [Generates complete email with all context]
```

## Key Features

- **Planning** â†’ Asks questions, builds outlines, guides strategy

### 2. Smart UI

## Technical Implementation

### System Prompt Strategy

**Planning Mode Prompt**:
```
"Flexible conversation space for:
1. General Questions & Learning
2. Exploration & Discovery  
3. Campaign Planning & Brainstorming

Adapt to user intent.
NEVER generate actual email copy."
```

**Email Copy Mode Prompt**:
```
"Expert copywriter creating high-converting emails.
Generate complete email structure with:
- Subject lines
- Hero sections
- Body copy
- CTAs"
```

### Stage Indicator Logic

```typescript
const isEmailPlanning = (): boolean => {
  // Check for planning keywords
  const planningKeywords = ['email', 'campaign', 'promote', ...];
  
  // Count keyword matches in user messages
  const keywordMatches = planningKeywords.filter(
    keyword => conversationText.includes(keyword)
  ).length;
  
  // Show if clear planning intent OR extended conversation
  return keywordMatches >= 2 || messages.length >= 6;
};

// Only render if email planning detected
if (!isEmailPlanning()) return null;
```

### Context Transfer

```typescript
const handleTransferPlanToEmail = async () => {
  // Capture ALL messages
  const allMessages = messages.map(m => 
    `${m.role === 'user' ? 'User' : 'Planning Session'}: ${m.content}`
  ).join('\n\n---\n\n');
  
  // Create comprehensive brief
  const briefPrompt = `Based on our planning discussion, 
  create an email campaign. Here's what we discussed:
  
  ${allMessages}
  
  Please generate complete email copy following all 
  guidelines we discussed.`;
  
  // Switch mode and pre-fill
  await handleToggleMode('email_copy');
  setDraftContent(briefPrompt);
};
```
