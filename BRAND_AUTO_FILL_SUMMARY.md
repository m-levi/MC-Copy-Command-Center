# Brand Auto-Fill Feature - Complete Summary

## 🎉 Feature Overview

The Brand Auto-Fill feature has been successfully implemented, allowing users to create brands in three flexible ways:

1. **✍️ Manual Entry** - Traditional form-based input
2. **📄 Upload Files** - Parse brand documents (TXT, MD, PDF, DOCX)
3. **🤖 AI Extract** - Automatically extract from URLs and/or files

This dramatically reduces the time needed to set up a new brand from 10-15 minutes down to under 2 minutes!
