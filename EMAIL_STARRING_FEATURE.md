# Email Starring Feature - Complete ✨

## Overview

I've implemented two major improvements to your chat experience:

1. **Beautiful Email Preview** - Professional email-style rendering instead of code blocks
2. **Email Starring System** - Save favorite emails as AI reference examples with RAG integration

## 🎨 Feature 1: Beautiful Email Preview

### What Changed
- Email copy now displays in a **beautiful, formatted email preview** by default
- Looks like an actual email with proper typography, spacing, and styling
- No more raw code blocks - professional presentation

### Features
- **Email header bar** with email icon and controls
- **Formatted content** with proper headings, paragraphs, lists
- **Syntax highlighting** for CTAs and important elements
- **Three display modes**:
  - **Preview Mode** (default) - Beautiful email formatting
  - **Raw Mode** - Original markdown view
  - **Sections Mode** - Editable sections view
- **One-click toggle** between modes

### Visual Improvements

- Blockquotes with left border
- Professional color scheme

## ⭐ Feature 2: Email Starring System

### What It Does
**Creates a feedback loop that makes AI progressively better at generating emails in your style.**

When you star an email:
1. It's saved to your brand's knowledge base as a "reference example"
2. The AI automatically uses it when generating future emails (via RAG)
3. Over time, the AI learns your exact preferences
4. Future emails become more aligned with your style

### How It Works

#### For Users
1. **Generate an email** in the chat
2. **Click the star icon** in the email preview
3. **Email is saved** with automatic categorization
4. **AI learns** from your favorite examples
5. **Future emails improve** based on your starred collection

#### For AI (Behind the Scenes)
1. Starred email content → Embedding generation
2. Embedding stored in `brand_documents` table (doc_type: 'example')
3. When generating new emails → RAG search finds relevant starred examples
4. AI context includes: Brand guidelines + Starred examples + Current request
5. Output quality improves with more starred examples

### User Interface

#### Star Button
- **Location**: Top-right of email preview
- **States**:
  - ⭐ Yellow/filled when starred
  - ☆ Gray/outline when not starred
- **Hover tooltip**: Explains the feature
- **Click once**: Stars the email
- **Click again**: Un-stars it

#### Starred Emails Manager

  - Right: Full email preview
- **Features**:

  - Visual count of saved examples

#### Info Banner
Shows in starred emails manager:
> "When you star an email, it's added to your brand's knowledge base. The AI automatically uses these examples to learn your preferred style, tone, and structure, making future emails better aligned with your standards."
