# üöÄ Smart UI Behavior - Quick Start

## What's New?

The app now feels **smarter and cleaner**! When you share URLs or the AI uses tools, you'll see a polished experience with the final result‚Äîno more cluttered explanations.

---

## ‚ú® What You'll Notice

### Before
```
User: "Write about this product: https://example.com/..."

AI says:
"I'll fetch the details about this product to create an email.
https://example.com/product-link
Perfect! I have all the details. Let me craft an email..."
```

**Problems:** Too much narration, messy URLs, robotic feel.

### After
```
User: "Write about this product: https://example.com/..."

Activity shows:
ü§î Thinking... 
üéØ Analyzing brand...
‚úçÔ∏è Crafting email...

AI response:
Clean, professional email copy (no clutter!)
```

**Benefits:** Smart, seamless, professional.

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. Share a URL
When you paste a product URL:
- ‚úÖ AI silently fetches the details
- ‚úÖ Activity indicator shows progress
- ‚úÖ You get clean email copy

### 2. AI Remembers Things
When AI learns preferences:
- ‚úÖ Memory saved automatically
- ‚úÖ No visible `[REMEMBER:...]` tags
- ‚úÖ Future chats use what it learned

### 3. Check the Thinking (Optional)
Want to see what the AI did?
- Click the **"Show Thinking"** dropdown
- See URL fetching, reasoning, decisions
- Power user feature‚Äîtotally optional

## üí° Examples

### Example 1: Product URL

**You send:**
```
Create an email about this whisky:
https://reallygoodwhisky.com/products/glentauchers-16-year-old-2009
```

**You see:**
- Activity: "Thinking ‚Üí Analyzing ‚Üí Crafting"
- Result: Clean email with product details
- No URL clutter in response

**Power user tip:** Expand "Show Thinking" to see the URL fetch details

---

### Example 2: Preference Learning

**You send:**
```
I prefer casual, friendly tone for all emails
```

**You see:**
- AI: "Got it! I'll use a casual tone."
- Memory saved silently
- Future emails automatically casual

**Behind the scenes:** `[REMEMBER:tone_preference=casual:user_preference]` (invisible to you)

---

### Example 3: Complex Request

**You send:**
```
Search for our newest products and create a promotional email
```

**You see:**
- Activity indicator showing progress
- Clean, final email copy
- No "I'm searching..." or "Let me fetch..."

**In thinking panel (optional):**
- "Searching brand website for new products..."
- "Found: Product A, Product B, Product C"
- "Crafting promotional email highlighting these items"

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Just Paste URLs
Don't explain what the URL is‚Äîjust paste it. The AI will figure it out.

**Good:**
```
Create an email about: https://example.com/product
```

**Also fine (but unnecessary):**
```
Create an email about this product page: https://example.com/product
```

### Tip 2: Trust the AI
The AI will use tools when needed. No need to ask it to "search" or "fetch."

**Good:**
```
Write about our summer collection
```

**Unnecessary:**
```
Please search our website for the summer collection and then write about it
```

### Tip 3: Check Thinking for Learning
Want to understand how the AI works? Check the thinking panel occasionally.

### Tip 4: Memory is Automatic
Tell the AI your preferences once, and it remembers automatically.
