# Testing the Flow Accordion Feature

## Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### Step 1: Clear Cache and Restart
```bash
# Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
cd "/Users/mordechailevi/Desktop/Manual Library/MoonCommerce/Dev Projects/command_center"
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Hard Refresh Browser
- Open the app
- Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
- This clears all cached JavaScript

### Step 3: Create a Test Flow
1. Go to any brand's chat page
2. Make sure you're in **WRITE** mode
3. Click the email type dropdown (says "Design")
4. Select **"Flow"**
5. Choose **"Abandoned Cart"** from the modal
6. Wait for the conversation to be created

### Step 4: Build the Outline
1. When AI asks questions, answer simply:
   - "Create an abandoned cart flow for my brand with 3 emails"
2. Wait for AI to generate the outline
3. When outline appears, say **"approved"**

### Step 5: Generate Emails
1. Click the **"Approve & Generate Emails"** button
2. Watch the progress modal
3. Wait for all 3 emails to generate
4. Should see success toast

### Step 6: Check the Sidebar

**What to look for:**

1. **Flow badge**: Look for conversation with "🔄 Flow" badge
2. **Flow type name**: Should see "Abandoned Cart" under the title
3. **Expand arrow**: Look for small arrow (▶) next to "Abandoned Cart"
4. **Click the arrow**: Should expand to show 3 child emails

**Expected result:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔄 Flow                         │
│ New Abandoned Cart Flow      ▼ │
│ 🛒 Abandoned Cart               │
│   ├─ #1 Reminder               │
│   ├─ #2 Objections             │
│   └─ #3 Final Offer            │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 7: Check Browser Console

Open browser console (F12 → Console) and look for these logs:

1. **When sidebar renders:**
   ```
   [ConversationCard] Flow conversation rendered: {
     id: "...",
     title: "New Abandoned Cart Flow",
     is_flow: true,
     flow_type: "abandoned_cart",
     isExpanded: false,
     childrenCount: 0
   }
   ```

2. **When you click the arrow:**
   ```
   [ConversationCard] Toggle expand clicked for ... Current: false
   [ConversationCard] Setting expanded to: true
   [ConversationCard] Loading children for flow: ...
   ```

3. **After loading children:**
   ```
   [ConversationCard] Loaded 3 children for flow ...
   ```

### Troubleshooting

**If you don't see flow info section at all:**
- Check console: Is `is_flow: true`?
- If not, the conversation wasn't created as a flow
- Try creating a new flow

**If you see flow info but no arrow:**
- The arrow is part of the flow info section
- It should always appear for flow conversations
- Check that the JSX is rendering (lines 176-204 in ConversationCard.tsx)

**If arrow appears but clicking does nothing:**
- Check console for "Toggle expand clicked"
- If you see the log, expansion is working
- If children don't show, check "Loading children" log

**If "No emails generated yet" appears:**
- This means the flow exists but has no children
- You need to approve an outline first
- Or the children weren't created successfully

**If children don't appear after generation:**
- Check that `loadConversations()` was called after generation
- Check that children aren't being filtered out
- Verify children exist in database

### Database Check

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if flow conversation exists
SELECT id, title, is_flow, flow_type, parent_conversation_id
FROM conversations
WHERE is_flow = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check if children exist
SELECT id, title, parent_conversation_id, flow_sequence_order, flow_email_title
FROM conversations
WHERE parent_conversation_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY parent_conversation_id, flow_sequence_order;
```

You should see:
1. Parent flows with `is_flow = true` and a `flow_type`
2. Child conversations with `parent_conversation_id` pointing to the parent

## What's Implemented

✅ Accordion UI in ConversationCard  
✅ Expand/collapse button  
✅ Children loading from database  
✅ Nested display with border  
✅ Sequence numbers (#1, #2, #3)  
✅ Email titles  
✅ Click to navigate  
✅ Active highlighting  
✅ Auto-expand when active  
✅ Loading states  
✅ Empty state  
✅ Debug logging  

Everything is in place - if you're not seeing it, it's a caching or data issue, not a code issue.

## Quick Verification

**Console commands to run:**

```javascript
// In browser console on the chat page

// Check if conversations have is_flow set
console.table(conversations.map(c => ({
  title: c.title,
  is_flow: c.is_flow,
  flow_type: c.flow_type,
  parent: c.parent_conversation_id
})));
```

This will show you exactly what the sidebar is receiving.
