## 🎯 How It Works

### Step 1: Choose Flow Type
Select from 6 professionally-designed flow types, each with research-backed strategies.

### Step 2: Build Outline
AI asks smart questions and creates a detailed outline showing:
- Email titles
- Send timing
- Purpose of each email
- Key points to cover
- Calls-to-action

### Step 3: Approve
Review the outline, request changes if needed, then approve. One click generates all emails!

### Step 4: Edit Individually
Each email lives in its own conversation. Click to open, chat naturally to edit.

**Example:** 
- "Make the subject line more intriguing"
- "Add more urgency to the CTA"
- "Shorten the first paragraph"

### Step 5: Done!
All emails ready to export and use in your email platform.
