# Clean Message Display - Quick Start Guide 🚀

**What Changed:** Chat messages now display in a **clean, readable code block format** instead of bunched-together markdown.

---

## What You'll See Now ✨

### Your Messages (User)
No changes - still appear in the blue bubble on the right side.

### AI Responses (Email Copy)
Now displayed in a **beautiful code block** with:
- ✅ Each line on its own line
- ✅ Clean monospaced font
- ✅ Perfect spacing
- ✅ Easy to copy

---

## Quick Visual Guide

### Before ❌
```
All the text bunched together like EMAIL SUBJECT LINE: 
Great Offer PREVIEW TEXT: Don't miss out HERO SECTION: 
Hello there...
```

### After ✅
```
EMAIL SUBJECT LINE: Great Offer

PREVIEW TEXT: Don't miss out

HERO SECTION:
Hello there...
```

**Much better!** 🎉

## How to Use

### 1. **Read Email Copy**
Just look at the clean text block - everything is clearly separated and easy to scan.
