# Letter Prompt & Mode Switching Improvements

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. **Improved Letter Email Prompt (AI Intelligence)**

**Problem:** The letter email prompt was asking the same questions repeatedly, ignoring context provided by the user.

**Solution:** Completely rewrote the prompt to be context-aware and intelligent.

#### Key Improvements:

**BE SMART AND CONTEXT-AWARE:**
- AI now reads the user's request carefully
- Uses information already provided - doesn't ask for what they already told you
- Only asks follow-up questions if critical information is genuinely missing
- Makes reasonable assumptions based on context rather than asking obvious questions

**SMART DEFAULTS:**
- If sender not mentioned → Uses "[Brand Name] Team" or "The Team at [Brand Name]"
- If recipient not mentioned → Uses generic greeting like "Hi there," or "Hey,"
- If tone not specified → Matches the brand voice from brand guidelines
- If specific details needed → Makes ONE concise request for what's truly missing

#### Examples in the Prompt:

**✅ Good Response (User provides context):**
```
User: "Write a thank you email to customers who just made their first purchase"
AI: Generates the email immediately using smart defaults
```

**✅ Good Response (Missing ONE critical detail):**
```
User: "Write a welcome email with a discount code"
AI: "I'll write that welcome email for you. What discount code and amount 
     should I include? (e.g., WELCOME20 for 20% off)"
```

**❌ Bad Response (OLD behavior - now fixed):**
```
User: "Write a thank you email for new customers"
AI: "Who should this be from? Who is it to? What's the tone? 
     What's the key message?"
(All of this is obvious from context!)
```

#### New Approach:

The AI now:
1. **Reads the request carefully** - understands what the user is asking
2. **Uses provided information** - doesn't ask for what they already said
3. **Makes intelligent defaults** - fills in reasonable assumptions
4. **Only asks when necessary** - one concise question for truly missing info
5. **Generates immediately** - when it has enough context

### 2. **One-Way Mode Switching**

**Problem:** Users could switch back and forth between Planning and Write mode at any time, which could be confusing once they've started generating emails.

**Solution:** Implemented one-way mode switching logic.

#### New Behavior:

**✅ From Planning → Write:**
- **Always allowed**
- User can start in Planning mode
- Can switch to Write mode at any time
- This is the natural progression

**❌ From Write → Planning:**
- **Disabled once messages exist**
- Once user starts using Write mode (has messages)
- Can no longer switch back to Planning
- Planning button becomes disabled and grayed out

#### Visual Feedback:

**Planning Mode (no messages):**
```
[PLAN] [WRITE]  ← Both clickable
```

**Planning Mode (with messages):**
```
[PLAN] [WRITE]  ← Both clickable, can switch to Write
```

**Write Mode (no messages):**
```
[PLAN] [WRITE]  ← Both clickable
```

**Write Mode (with messages):**
```
[PLAN] [WRITE]  ← PLAN is disabled (grayed out, not clickable)
    ↑
Can't go back
```

#### User Experience:

**Disabled State:**
- Button is grayed out: `opacity-50`
- Cursor shows not-allowed: `cursor-not-allowed`
- Reduced contrast: `text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600`
- Helpful tooltip: "Can't switch to planning mode after starting write mode"

**Why This Makes Sense:**
1. Planning is for brainstorming and strategy
2. Write is for executing and creating emails
3. Once you start creating emails (Write mode), going back to Planning doesn't make sense
4. But you can always start Planning and move to Write

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Letter Prompt Changes (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)

**Updated `buildLetterEmailPrompt()` function:**
- Added "BE SMART AND CONTEXT-AWARE" section
- Added "SMART DEFAULTS" section
- Added "EXAMPLES OF BEING INTELLIGENT" with good/bad examples
- Emphasized reading user's request carefully
- Clear instruction: "Only ask follow-up questions if something critical is genuinely missing"
- Key principle: "Read the user's request carefully and generate the email using the information they provide"

### Mode Switching Changes

**ChatInput Component (`components/ChatInput.tsx`):**
- Added `hasMessages?: boolean` prop to interface
- Added `hasMessages = false` to function parameters
- Updated PLAN button with:
  - `disabled={mode === 'email_copy' && hasMessages}`
  - Conditional styling for disabled state
  - Updated title/tooltip for disabled state

**Chat Page (`app/brands/[brandId]/chat/page.tsx`):**
- Pass `hasMessages={messages.length > 0}` to ChatInput component
- Checks if conversation has any messages
- Dynamically enables/disables planning mode button

## 📝 Example Scenarios

### Letter Email - Smart Generation

**Scenario 1: Complete context provided**
```
User: "Write a thank you email from our founder Sarah to customers 
       who just completed their first purchase"

AI Response: [Generates email immediately with:]
- Sender: Sarah, Founder
- Recipient: Hi there,
- Purpose: Thank you
- Message: Appreciation for first purchase
- Tone: Warm and personal (from brand guidelines)
```

**Scenario 2: One missing detail**
```
User: "Write a welcome email with a special discount"

AI Response: "I'll write that welcome email for you! What discount 
              code and percentage should I include?"

User: "Use WELCOME15 for 15% off"

AI Response: [Generates complete email]
```

**Scenario 3: Minimal context**
```
User: "Write a re-engagement email"

AI Response: [Generates email with smart defaults:]
- Sender: The [Brand Name] Team
- Recipient: Hey,
- Purpose: Re-engagement
- Message: Miss you, here's what's new, special offer
- Tone: Friendly but not pushy
```

### Mode Switching - One-Way Flow

**Scenario 1: Natural progression**
```
1. User creates conversation → Defaults to Planning mode
2. User brainstorms in Planning mode
3. User switches to Write mode
4. User generates emails
5. PLAN button is now disabled ✓
```

**Scenario 2: Starting in Write**
```
1. User creates conversation → Defaults to Planning mode
2. User immediately switches to Write mode (no planning needed)
3. User generates first email
4. PLAN button is now disabled ✓
```

**Scenario 3: Empty conversation**
```
1. User creates conversation
2. No messages yet
3. Both PLAN and WRITE buttons are active
4. User can switch freely
```
