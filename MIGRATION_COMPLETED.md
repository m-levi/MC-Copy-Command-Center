## Rollback Instructions (If Needed)

If you need to rollback this migration:

```sql
-- Warning: This will delete all organization data
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS organization_invites CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS organization_members CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS organizations CASCADE;
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS organization_role;

-- Restore original columns
ALTER TABLE profiles DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS full_name;
ALTER TABLE profiles DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS avatar_url;
ALTER TABLE brands DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;
ALTER TABLE brands DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS created_by;
ALTER TABLE conversations DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS created_by_name;

-- Restore original RLS policies (you'll need to recreate them)
```

**Note:** Only rollback if absolutely necessary. This will require recreating the original RLS policies.

## Support & Troubleshooting

### If brands don't load:
```sql
-- Verify brands have organization_id
SELECT id, name, organization_id, created_by FROM brands;
```

### If you can't access the admin page:
```sql
-- Verify you're an admin
SELECT om.role, o.name 
FROM organization_members om
JOIN organizations o ON om.organization_id = o.id
WHERE om.user_id = auth.uid();
```

### Check RLS policies:
```sql
-- View all RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('brands', 'conversations', 'organizations', 'organization_members', 'organization_invites')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```
