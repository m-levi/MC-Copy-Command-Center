## üéØ How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User clicks FLOW** mode button
2. **Flow Type Selector appears** with 6 options
3. **User selects flow type** (e.g., "Abandoned Cart")
4. **New flow conversation created**
5. **AI asks clarifying questions** about the flow
6. **User provides details** (goal, audience, products, tone, etc.)
7. **AI generates detailed outline** with timing, purpose, key points per email
8. **User reviews outline** and can request changes
9. **User says "approved"** (or similar)
10. **Approve button appears** prominently
11. **User clicks approve**
12. **System generates all emails in parallel** (fast!)
13. **FlowOutlineDisplay shows** all emails with progress
14. **User clicks any email** to open its conversation
15. **User can edit email naturally** through chat
16. **FlowNavigation shows breadcrumbs** for easy navigation
17. **User switches between emails** or returns to parent flow

### Technical Flow

1. Flow conversation has `is_flow=true`, `flow_type='abandoned_cart'`
2. AI uses `buildFlowOutlinePrompt()` for conversation
3. System parses outline with `detectFlowOutline()`
4. On approval, API creates outline record
5. API creates N child conversations (one per email)
6. Each child has `parent_conversation_id` linking to flow
7. Each child has `flow_sequence_order` for ordering
8. Emails generated in parallel using `Promise.all()`
9. Each email saved as first message in child conversation
10. User can navigate parent ‚Üî children naturally
