## 🤔 When Are Conversations Deleted?

### Empty = No Messages
A conversation is "empty" if it has **zero messages** (no user messages, no AI responses).

### 3 Cleanup Scenarios

| Scenario | Action | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 🆕 Click "New Conversation" | While in empty conversation | Old empty → deleted |
| 🔄 Switch Conversations | While in empty conversation | Empty → deleted |
| 🚪 Leave Page | While in empty conversation | Empty → cleaned up |

## ✅ What Gets Deleted

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Empty Conversation         │
│  • No messages              │  ❌ AUTO-DELETED
│  • Just created             │
│  • Never used               │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## ❌ What DOESN'T Get Deleted

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Conversation with Content  │

│  • User typed something     │
│  • AI responded             │
└─────────────────────────────┘

```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Detection
```typescript
// Conversation is empty when:
messages.length === 0
```

### Deletion Points
```typescript
1. handleNewConversation()      // Before creating new
2. handleSelectConversation()   // Before switching
3. useEffect cleanup            // On unmount
```

### Tracking
```typescript
// Analytics event fired:
trackEvent('conversation_auto_deleted', {
  conversationId: string,
  reason: 'empty_on_new_click' | 'empty_on_switch' | 'empty_on_unmount'
});
```

## 💡 Tips

### ✅ DO
- Create conversations freely - empty ones auto-cleanup
- Switch between conversations without worry
- Start fresh each time you open a brand

### ❌ DON'T
- Don't worry about cleaning up empty conversations
- Don't manually delete them - it happens automatically
- Don't expect empty conversations to persist

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Conversation with messages disappeared?
**Shouldn't happen!** Auto-delete only affects empty conversations.  
→ Check console for errors  
→ Check Supabase logs

### Empty conversations not deleting?
→ Check browser console  
→ Verify Supabase connection  
→ Check real-time subscriptions
