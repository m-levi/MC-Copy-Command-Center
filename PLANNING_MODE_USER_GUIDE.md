# Planning Mode - User Guide

## What is Planning Mode?

Planning Mode is a collaborative strategy session with your AI email marketing consultant. Instead of immediately generating email copy, the AI helps you think through your campaign step-by-step.

Think of it as having a brainstorming session with an expert before writing anything.

## When to Use Planning Mode

‚úÖ **Use Planning Mode when:**
- You have an idea but need help fleshing it out
- You're not sure about your messaging approach
- You want to explore different angles
- You're creating a complex or important campaign
- You need help understanding your audience
- You want strategic advice on structure

‚úÖ **Skip to Email Copy Mode when:**
- You already know exactly what you want
- You have a clear, simple request
- You're in a hurry and need quick copy
- You've already planned elsewhere

## How Planning Mode Works

### Stage 1: Discovery üîç
**What happens**: The AI asks questions to understand your goals

**Example conversation**:
```
You: "I want to create an email about our summer sale"

AI: "Let me help you plan this! A few questions:
     - Who is this targeting - existing customers or prospects?
     - What's the discount/offer?
     - Is there a deadline?
     - What products will you highlight?"
```

**Your role**: Answer questions, share context, clarify your goals

### Stage 2: Strategy üìã
**What happens**: Together you build an outline and approach

**Example conversation**:
```
You: "Existing customers, 30% off, ends Sunday, 
      focusing on summer dresses"

AI: "Perfect! Here are some strategic approaches:
     
     Approach 1: Urgency-driven
     - Lead with deadline + discount
     - Focus on scarcity (limited time)
     
     Approach 2: Value-driven  
     - Lead with summer dress collection
     - Discount as secondary incentive
     
     Which fits your brand tone better?"
     
     Suggested Outline:
     - Hero: Deadline + key visual
     - Section 1: Featured summer dresses
     - Section 2: Why now (weather, events, etc.)
     - CTA: Shop before Sunday
```

**Your role**: Provide feedback, refine the approach, build consensus on structure

### Stage 3: Ready ‚úÖ
**What happens**: Plan is complete, ready to generate

**You see**: 
- Progress bar at 100%
- Green checkmark on "Ready" stage
- "Transfer Plan" button appears

**What to do**: Click "Transfer Plan" to move to Email Copy mode

## Tips for Great Planning Sessions

### 1. Start with Context
‚ùå Bad: "I need an email"
‚úÖ Good: "I need a promotional email for our new sustainable product line launching next week"

### 2. Answer Questions Thoroughly  
‚ùå Bad: "Regular customers"
‚úÖ Good: "Existing customers who've purchased eco-friendly products before, mostly aged 25-40"

### 3. Be Open to Suggestions
The AI might suggest angles you hadn't considered. Explore them!

### 4. Iterate Freely
Don't rush. It's okay to:
- Ask "What if we tried X approach?"
- Request multiple outline options
- Change direction mid-planning

### 5. Use the Stages as a Guide
- Discovery: Answer ALL the questions first
- Strategy: Don't move on until you have a clear outline
- Ready: Review everything before transferring

## Sample Planning Conversations

### Example 1: Holiday Campaign

```
User: "I want to create a Black Friday email campaign"

AI: "Exciting! Let's plan this strategically. A few questions:
     - When will this send (before, during, or after Black Friday)?
     - What's your offer/discount?
     - Top 3 product categories to feature?
     - Any early access for VIPs?"

User: "Sends Thursday evening before BF. 40% off everything. 
      Top categories: electronics, home goods, fashion. 
      Yes, early access for email subscribers."

AI: "Perfect positioning! Here's my strategic recommendation:
     
     **Messaging Angle**: VIP Early Access + FOMO
     
     **Key Message**: "You're getting first access before 
     the crowds"
     
     **Suggested Outline**:
     - Hero: Early Access Exclusive (creates VIP feeling)
     - Section 1: Top deals by category (scannable)
     - Section 2: Shop now vs. wait for Friday chaos
     - Section 3: Free shipping threshold  
     - CTA: Start Shopping Your Early Access
     
     **Tone**: Excited but not desperate, emphasize the 
     privilege of early access
     
     Does this approach align with your brand?"

User: "Yes! Love the VIP angle. Should we add urgency?"

AI: "Great question! For early access, I'd recommend subtle 
     urgency rather than aggressive countdown. Try:
     
     - 'Early Access ends midnight Thursday'
     - 'Before everyone else gets in'
     - Avoid: 'ONLY X HOURS LEFT!!!'
     
     This maintains the premium feeling while creating action.
     
     Ready to transfer this plan and generate the email?"
```

### Example 2: Product Launch

```
User: "We're launching a new product line and need an 
      announcement email"

AI: "Congrats on the launch! Let's strategize:
     - What type of product?
     - New to market or new for your brand?
     - Who's most excited about this?
     - Any launch special/incentive?"

User: "It's a new skincare line focused on sensitive skin. 
      New for us but category exists. Target is people with 
      skin sensitivity issues. We have a launch discount."

AI: "This is a solve-a-problem product, not just a new 
     thing. Big difference! Strategic recommendations:
     
     **Approach**: Problem-Solution, Not Product Announcement
     
     **Don't lead with**: 'Introducing our new line!'
     **Do lead with**: 'Finally, skincare that doesn't 
     irritate sensitive skin'
     
     **Outline**:
     - Hero: The problem (sensitive skin struggle) + solution
     - Section 1: Why existing products fail sensitive skin
     - Section 2: What makes this different (3 key benefits)
     - Section 3: Dermatologist-tested, hypoallergenic proof
     - Section 4: Launch offer
     - CTA: Shop the new collection
     
     **Key Messages**:
     - Developed specifically for sensitivity
     - Gentle but effective
     - Backed by testing/science
     
     Questions:
     - Any clinical testing to mention?
     - Customer testimonials from beta testing?"
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I switch modes mid-conversation?**
A: Yes! Use the mode toggle at the top. But it's better to complete planning first.

**Q: What if I don't want to answer all the questions?**
A: Tell the AI you want to skip to an outline. It will adapt.

**Q: Can I plan multiple emails at once?**
A: You can discuss multiple emails, but transfer one plan at a time.

**Q: What if the AI generates copy anyway?**
A: Shouldn't happen, but if it does, remind it: "I'm still planning, not ready for copy yet"

**Q: How many exchanges is typical?**
A: 4-8 messages usually. But take as long as you need!

**Q: Can I save just the plan without generating?**
A: Yes! Your planning conversation is saved. You can transfer later.
