---

## How to Use

### Step 1: Start a Flow

1. Go to any brand's chat page
2. In WRITE mode, click the dropdown that says "Design"
3. Select **"Flow"** from the dropdown
4. A beautiful modal will appear with 6 flow type options

### Step 2: Choose Flow Type

Select from:
- 👋 **Welcome Series** (3 emails) - Onboard new subscribers
- 🛒 **Abandoned Cart** (3 emails) - Recover lost sales  
- 💝 **Post-Purchase** (3 emails) - Thank & encourage repeats
- 💌 **Win-back Series** (4 emails) - Re-engage inactive customers
- 🚀 **Product Launch** (5 emails) - Build hype for new products
- 📚 **Educational Series** (5 emails) - Educate and nurture leads

### Step 3: Build the Outline

1. AI will ask clarifying questions about:
   - Goal of the flow
   - Target audience
   - Products/offers to highlight
   - Tone preference
   - Timing constraints

2. Answer the questions naturally

3. AI will generate a detailed outline with:
   - Each email's title
   - Timing (when it sends)
   - Purpose
   - Key points to cover
   - Call-to-action

4. Review the outline

5. Request changes if needed, or say **"approved"** / **"looks good"** / **"let's proceed"**

### Step 4: Approve & Generate

1. The **"Approve Outline"** button appears
2. Click it
3. System generates all emails in parallel (10-15 seconds)
4. Each email is created in its own separate conversation

### Step 5: Edit Individual Emails

1. The **Flow Outline Display** shows all emails with checkmarks
2. Click any email to open its conversation
3. Chat naturally with AI to edit that specific email
4. Example: "Make the subject line more intriguing" or "Add more urgency"
5. Click "← Back to Flow" to return to the main flow view

### Step 6: Navigate Between Emails

- Use the **Flow Outline Display** to jump between emails
- Use **breadcrumbs** when in a child email: Brand → Flow → Email N
- Each email conversation is independent - no clutter!

## Architecture

### Parent-Child Model

```
Flow Conversation (Parent)
├── Outline building conversation
├── Approved outline stored in database
└── Children (one per email)
    ├── Email 1 Conversation (editable)
    ├── Email 2 Conversation (editable)
    ├── Email 3 Conversation (editable)
    └── Email N Conversation (editable)
```

### Data Flow

1. User selects "Flow" from dropdown → Modal appears
2. User selects flow type → Creates parent conversation with `is_flow=true`
3. AI uses flow outline prompt → Asks questions
4. AI generates outline → System detects it
5. User says "approved" → Approve button appears
6. User clicks approve → API generates all emails in parallel
7. Each email saved in separate child conversation
8. User clicks email in outline → Opens child conversation
9. User edits email naturally → Just chat with AI
10. User returns to flow → Sees all emails with status

## Example Flow

**Scenario: Creating Abandoned Cart Flow**

1. **Select Flow:**
   - Click "Design" dropdown → Select "Flow"
   - Choose "Abandoned Cart" from modal

2. **Build Outline:**
   ```
   User: "I want to recover carts for my jewelry brand. 
         Luxury pieces $500-5000. No discount, elegant tone."
   
   AI: "Perfect! For luxury jewelry, let's create an abandoned 
        cart sequence that emphasizes exclusivity rather than discounts.
        
        A few questions:
        - Any specific pieces to highlight? (engagement rings, necklaces, etc.)
        - Messaging angle: scarcity (limited pieces) or personal touch?
        
        Or I can create a draft outline now."
   
   User: "Focus on engagement rings. Personal touch approach."
   
   AI: [Generates 3-email outline]
        "Does this outline work for you?"
   
   User: "Looks perfect!"
   ```

3. **Approve:**
   - Approve button appears
   - Click it
   - "Generating 3 emails..."
   - Success! Outline display shows all 3 emails

4. **Edit Email 2:**
   - Click "Email 2: Exclusive Reminder"
   - Opens Email 2's conversation
   - User: "Add more emphasis on the craftsmanship"
   - AI regenerates with more craftsmanship focus
   - User: "Perfect!"

5. **Export or Continue:**
   - Return to flow view
   - All emails ready
   - Can export or continue refining
