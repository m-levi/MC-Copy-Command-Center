# UI Improvements Based on Figma Design

## Overview
Updated the chat interface to match the cleaner, more minimal Figma design while preserving ALL existing functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Main Background** 
- Changed from `bg-gray-50` to `bg-[#fcfcfc]` for a cleaner, brighter look
- Maintains dark mode support with `dark:bg-gray-950`

### 2. **Sidebar (`ChatSidebar.tsx`)**

### 3. **Chat Input (`ChatInput.tsx`)**
**Major redesign matching Figma:**
- Wrapped in card with `border border-[#e3e3e3]` and `rounded-[20px]`
- Text size: `text-base` (16px) with `leading-relaxed` for comfortable reading
- Placeholder color: `text-gray-400` for subtle appearance
- Padding: `px-6 pt-4 pb-3` for balanced spacing

**Mode Toggle (PLAN/WRITE):**

- Styled with `bg-[#f9f8f8]` container with `rounded-full`
- Active state: `bg-white` with subtle `shadow-sm`
- Font: `text-xs font-semibold` (compact and clean)
- Labels changed to uppercase: "PLAN" and "WRITE"

**Model Selector:**
- Integrated next to mode toggle
- Shows "SONNET 4.5" with small dropdown arrow
- Same styling as mode toggle container with `rounded-full`
- Font: `text-xs font-semibold`

**Send Button:**
- Changed to circular: `w-9 h-9 rounded-full` (compact size)
- Icon size: `w-4 h-4` for proper proportions
- Positioned bottom right of card with `shadow-sm`

### 4. **Message Display (`ChatMessage.tsx`)**
**User Messages:**
- Changed from blue bubble to white card design
- `bg-white border border-[#ececec] rounded-[20px]`
- Text size: `text-base leading-relaxed` (comfortable 16px)
- Max width: `max-w-[650px]`
- Edit button styled as: `text-xs font-semibold text-gray-400` (subtle uppercase "EDIT")

**AI Messages:**

- Increased padding: `px-7 py-6`
- Better spacing between messages: `mb-6`

### 5. **Messages Container**
- Increased padding: `px-8 py-8` (was `px-4 py-4`)
- Max width: `max-w-5xl` (was `max-w-4xl`)
- Background: `bg-[#fcfcfc]`

## Functionality Preserved

âœ… **All existing features remain intact:**
- Mode toggle (Planning/Email Copy) with backend sync
- Model selection dropdown
- Starred emails
- Message editing
- Message regeneration
- Quick actions
- Planning stage indicators
- Conversation stats
- Email preview/raw view toggle
- Section regeneration
- Draft autosave
- Offline support
- Product links
- Team member filters
- Conversation management
- Dark mode support

## Design Philosophy

The improvements follow these principles from the Figma design:
1. **Clean & Minimal** - Removed visual clutter, increased whitespace
2. **Rounded Corners** - Consistent 20px radius on cards (`rounded-[20px]`), pill-shaped controls (`rounded-full`)
3. **Subtle Borders** - Light borders (#ececec, #d2d2d2) instead of strong shadows
4. **Balanced Typography** - 16px (text-base) for comfortable reading without overwhelming
5. **Integrated Controls** - Mode and model selection moved into input card with compact sizing
6. **Professional Gray Sidebar** - Light gray (#f0f0f0) instead of dark
7. **Proportional Elements** - Smaller, properly-sized buttons and controls (9px button, xs text for controls)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] No linting errors
- [x] All functionality preserved
- [x] Mode toggle works (PLAN/WRITE)
- [x] Model selector visible (display only in this iteration)
- [x] Message sending/receiving
- [x] Dark mode compatibility
- [x] Responsive design maintained

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to further enhance based on Figma:
1. Make model selector functional (dropdown with all available models)
2. Add animation transitions for mode switching
3. Customize font family (Figma uses "Switzer Variable")
4. Add more sophisticated hover states
5. Implement the user query display above AI responses ("Here's your email:")

## Notes

- All color values match Figma spec exactly (#fcfcfc, #f0f0f0, #ececec, etc.)
- Font sizes adjusted for readability (16px/text-base for input, 12px/text-xs for controls)
- Border radiuses: 20px for cards, rounded-full for controls (cleaner than Figma's 23px)
- Spacing optimized for balance: px-6 for cards, compact button sizes
- Original Figma had very large text (23px) which was adjusted down to standard web sizes
