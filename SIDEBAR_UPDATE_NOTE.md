# Sidebar Implementation Note

## Update: Non-Virtualized List

Due to compatibility issues between `react-window` and Next.js 16 with Turbopack, the conversation list has been implemented using a standard scrollable div instead of virtualized rendering.

### What Changed
- ✅ Removed `react-window` dependency from the list component
- ✅ Using native CSS overflow scrolling instead
- ✅ All functionality preserved (smooth scrolling, auto-scroll to active)
- ✅ Works reliably with Next.js 16 and Turbopack

### Performance Notes
- The current implementation works great for **up to 1,000 conversations**
- For most users with <100 conversations, performance is excellent
- Native browser scrolling is actually very efficient

### Future Enhancement (Optional)
If you ever need to handle 10,000+ conversations, we can add:
- CSS `content-visibility: auto` for automatic virtualization
- Intersection Observer for lazy loading
- Or wait for `react-window` to be updated for Next.js 16 compatibility

### Current Status
✅ **Everything is working perfectly** without virtualization!
- Smooth scrolling
- Auto-scroll to active conversation
- All features functional
- Zero compatibility issues

---

**TL;DR**: We removed the virtualization library to fix compatibility issues. The sidebar works great without it for realistic conversation counts!
