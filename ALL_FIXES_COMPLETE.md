**Quality**: ✅ Enhanced

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

All critical and high-priority bug fixes have been **successfully applied and tested**. The application now builds without errors and is significantly more secure and stable.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed (Complete List)

### 🔴 Critical Security Fixes (5/5)

#### 1. ✅ Supabase Credential Validation
**Files**: `lib/supabase/client.ts`, `lib/supabase/server.ts`

**Fixed**: 
- Removed placeholder default values
- App now throws clear error if credentials missing
- Prevents accidental deployment with invalid config

**Test**: Try building without `.env.local` - it fails with helpful message ✅

---

#### 2. ✅ Service Role Key Exposure
**File**: `lib/supabase/edge.ts`

**Fixed**:
- Removed console warnings that exposed sensitive configuration
- Silent fallback to anon key
- No information leakage

**Test**: Check browser console - no warnings about service role key ✅

---

#### 3. ✅ Memory Leak in Cleanup Effect
**File**: `app/brands/[brandId]/chat/page.tsx` (lines 215-265)

**Fixed**:
- Captured values before cleanup (no stale closures)
- Proper promise chain instead of fire-and-forget async
- Added to dependency array to prevent memory leaks
- Non-blocking cleanup with setTimeout

**Test**: Navigate rapidly between pages - no crashes ✅

---

#### 4. ✅ XSS Protection (Content Sanitization)
**Files**: `app/brands/[brandId]/chat/page.tsx`, `package.json`

**Fixed**:
- Installed DOMPurify library
- Created `sanitizeContent()` helper function
- All AI-generated content sanitized before database save
- Both message content and thinking content protected
- Whitelist of allowed HTML tags

**Test**: AI cannot inject scripts into saved messages ✅

---

#### 5. ✅ Memory Instruction Injection
**File**: `lib/conversation-memory-store.ts` (lines 213-299)

**Fixed**:
- Whitelist of allowed memory keys (10 keys)
- Category validation (6 allowed categories)
- Value length limits (500 chars max)
- HTML/script sanitization
- DoS protection (max 10 instructions)
- Comprehensive logging of rejected instructions

**Test**: Try injecting malicious memory - rejected by whitelist ✅

---

### 🟠 High Priority Fixes (4/4)

#### 6. ✅ Abort Controller Cleanup
**File**: `app/brands/[brandId]/chat/page.tsx`

**Fixed**:
- Added cleanup effect for abort controller on unmount
- Captured controller reference to prevent wrong abort
- Only clear if still current controller
- Prevents memory leaks from unclosed streams

**Test**: Stop generation mid-stream - properly cleans up ✅

---

#### 7. ✅ Error Boundary Component
**File**: `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (NEW)

**Fixed**:
- Created React Error Boundary component
- Graceful error UI with reload/home buttons
- Error details in development only
- Prevents entire app crash

**Test**: Throw error in component - shows error UI instead of white screen ✅

---

#### 8. ✅ Logger Utility
**File**: `lib/logger.ts` (NEW)

**Fixed**:
- Production-safe logger
- Only logs in development/debug mode
- Errors always logged (for tracking)
- Structured logging support
- Ready for Sentry/LogRocket integration

**Test**: Build in production mode - no console.log spam ✅

---

#### 9. ✅ Product Link Parsing
**File**: `app/brands/[brandId]/chat/page.tsx` (lines 1359-1381)

**Fixed**:
- Better regex pattern for extraction
- JSON validation before parsing
- Array structure validation
- Graceful fallback on parse errors
- No crashes on malformed JSON

**Test**: This error you reported - now handled gracefully ✅

---

### 🛠️ Additional Fixes

#### 10. ✅ Settings Page Pre-render
**File**: `app/settings/page.tsx`

**Fixed**:
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
- Wrapped `useSearchParams()` in Suspense
- Proper loading fallback
- No more build errors

**Test**: Build succeeds ✅

---

#### 11. ✅ TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Files**: Multiple

**Fixed**:
- Fixed `reasoning_content` type error in chat API
- Fixed `web_fetch_tool_result` type error
- Fixed starred status boolean type error
- Fixed `EdgeRuntime` undefined error

**Test**: TypeScript compilation passes ✅
