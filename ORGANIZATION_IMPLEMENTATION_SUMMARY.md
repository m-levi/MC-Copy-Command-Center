# Multi-Tenant Organization System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete multi-tenant organization system with role-based access control, invite-only signup, team collaboration features, and conversation attribution.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema (ORGANIZATION_MIGRATION.sql)

**New Tables:**
- `organizations` - Stores organization details (e.g., "Moon Commerce")
- `organization_members` - Links users to organizations with roles
- `organization_invites` - Manages invitation tokens and tracking

**Modified Tables:**
- `profiles` - Added `full_name` and `avatar_url` fields
- `brands` - Added `organization_id` and `created_by` fields
- `conversations` - Added `created_by_name` field for display

**Security:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all new and modified tables
- Organization-scoped data access
- Role-based permissions enforcement at database level

### 2. Type Definitions (types/index.ts)

Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces:
- `Organization`, `OrganizationMember`, `OrganizationInvite`
- `OrganizationRole` enum (admin, brand_manager, member)
- `UserWithOrganization` helper type
- Updated existing types with organization fields

### 3. Permission System (lib/permissions.ts)

Helper functions for authorization:
- `getUserOrganization()` - Get user's org and role
- `getUserRole()` - Check specific role
- `canCreateBrand()` - Admin and brand_manager only
- `canEditBrand()`, `canDeleteBrand()` - Permission checks
- `canManageMembers()` - Admin only
- `getOrganizationMembers()` - Fetch team list

### 4. API Routes

**Invitation Management:**
- `POST /api/organizations/invites` - Create invitation (admin only)
- `GET /api/organizations/invites` - List all invitations
- `GET /api/organizations/invites/validate` - Validate token
- `DELETE /api/organizations/invites/[id]` - Revoke invitation

**Member Management:**
- `GET /api/organizations/members` - List organization members
- `PATCH /api/organizations/members/[id]` - Update member role (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/organizations/members/[id]` - Remove member (admin only)

### 5. Authentication Flow

**Invite-Based Signup (`/signup/[token]`):**
1. Validates invitation token
2. Displays organization name and role
3. Pre-fills email from invitation
4. Creates user account
5. Adds user to organization
6. Marks invitation as used
7. Redirects to brand dashboard

**Login Flow Updates:**
- Checks organization membership
- Redirects to organization dashboard
- Blocks access if not part of any organization

### 6. Admin Dashboard (`/admin/page.tsx`)

Features:
- Send team invitations with email and role
- View pending invitations with expiration dates
- Revoke unused invitations
- View all team members with profiles
- Change member roles
- Remove team members
- Display organization name

### 7. UI Components

**New Components:**
- `UserRoleBadge` - Visual role indicator with icons
- `InviteForm` - Send invitations with link copying
- `TeamMemberList` - Manage team members
- `ConversationFilterDropdown` - Filter conversations by creator

**Updated Components:**
- `BrandCard` - Shows creator name, checks permissions for edit/delete
- `ChatSidebar` - Displays creator names, integrates filter dropdown
- Home Page (`app/page.tsx`) - Organization-aware, permission-based brand creation

### 8. Conversation Attribution

**Features Implemented:**
- Stores creator name when conversation is created
- Displays "Created by [name]" on each conversation
- Filter conversations by:
  - All Team - See everyone's conversations
  - Just Mine - See only your own conversations
  - By Person - Select specific team member

**Filtering Logic:**
- Maintains full conversation list
- Applies client-side filtering for performance
- Preserves filter state during session

### 9. Permission-Based UI

**Brand Management:**
- "Create Brand" button only visible to admins and brand_managers
- Edit/delete options only shown to users with permissions
- Organization name displayed in header

**Team Management:**
- "Team Management" link only visible to admins
- Role change and member removal restricted to admins
- Users cannot modify their own role or remove themselves

### 10. Data Migration

**Automatic Migration:**
- Creates default "Moon Commerce" organization
- Migrates all existing users as admins
- Updates all brands to belong to Moon Commerce
- Adds creator attribution to existing brands
- Updates conversation creator names from profiles

## Security Features

1. **Row Level Security:** All database queries filtered by organization membership
2. **API Authorization:** Server-side permission checks on all endpoints
3. **Token Security:** 32-character random tokens, 7-day expiration, single-use
4. **Role Enforcement:** Database functions validate permissions
5. **Data Isolation:** Users can only access their organization's data

## User Roles

### Admin
- Send invitations
- Manage team members (add, remove, change roles)
- Create and manage brands
- Delete brands
- Full conversation access

### Brand Manager
- Create and edit brands
- View all team conversations
- Cannot manage team members
- Cannot delete brands (admin only)

### Member

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Run Migration:**
   ```bash
   # Execute ORGANIZATION_MIGRATION.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
   ```

2. **Verify Data:**
   - Check all users are in Moon Commerce organization
   - Verify all brands have organization_id set
   - Confirm RLS policies are active

3. **Test Scenarios:**
   - Create invitation and sign up new user
   - Test role permissions (admin, brand_manager, member)
   - Verify conversation filtering works
   - Test brand creation/editing permissions
   - Ensure data isolation between organizations (future)

4. **Email Integration (Future):**
   - Add email service (SendGrid, Resend, etc.)
   - Send invitation emails with links
   - Add email notifications for team activity

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `ORGANIZATION_MIGRATION.sql`
- `lib/permissions.ts`
- `app/api/organizations/invites/route.ts`
- `app/api/organizations/invites/validate/route.ts`
- `app/api/organizations/invites/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/organizations/members/route.ts`
- `app/api/organizations/members/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/signup/[token]/page.tsx`
- `app/admin/page.tsx`
- `components/UserRoleBadge.tsx`
- `components/InviteForm.tsx`
- `components/TeamMemberList.tsx`
- `components/ConversationFilterDropdown.tsx`
- `ORGANIZATION_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
- `types/index.ts` - Added organization types
- `app/page.tsx` - Organization-aware brand listing
- `components/BrandCard.tsx` - Creator attribution and permissions
- `components/ChatSidebar.tsx` - Filter dropdown and creator names
- `app/brands/[brandId]/chat/page.tsx` - Conversation filtering and attribution

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Single Organization Per User:** Simplified the initial implementation. Can be extended to multi-org in future.

2. **Invite-Only Signup:** Ensures controlled access. Public signup can be added later if needed.

3. **Creator Name Storage:** Denormalized to avoid joins on every conversation query. Improves performance.

4. **Client-Side Filtering:** Conversations filtered on client for better UX. Server-side filtering can be added for scale.

5. **RLS + Application Layer:** Double security with database policies and application-level checks.

## Migration Notes

- All existing users become admins in Moon Commerce organization
- Existing brands maintain their functionality
- No breaking changes to existing features
- Backward compatible with current conversations
- Migration is idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)

## Known Limitations

1. Users can only belong to one organization currently
2. No organization switching UI (not needed for single-org)
3. Invitation emails not sent automatically (manual sharing of link)
4. No organization settings page yet
5. No audit log for permission changes

## Future Enhancements

1. Organization settings and customization
2. Email notifications for invitations
3. Activity logs and audit trail
4. Advanced permission granularity
5. Organization branding (logo, colors)
6. Multi-organization support per user
7. Organization analytics dashboard
8. Bulk user import
9. SSO integration
10. API key management per organization
