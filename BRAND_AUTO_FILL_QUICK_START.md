### Combining Both
For the most comprehensive results:

3. **Save Your Work** - Click "Create Brand" when you're satisfied

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to extract brand information"
**Try this:**
- Check if the URL is accessible
- Upload text files instead of PDFs
- Provide more/different documents
- Use manual entry as a fallback

### "File is too large"
**Solution:**
- Files must be under 5MB
- Try converting to plain text (.txt)
- Split large documents into smaller files

### "Website can't be accessed"
**Solution:**
- Verify the URL is correct
- Make sure the site is public (not password-protected)
- Try uploading brand documents instead

### Extraction is taking too long
**Solution:**
- Wait up to 30 seconds for completion
- If it times out, try with less content
- Use URL-only first, then add documents

## 🎯 Quick Examples

### E-commerce Brand
```
URL: https://yourstore.com
Files: 
  - brand-guidelines.txt
  - product-descriptions.md

Result: Complete brand profile with product focus
```

### Service Business
