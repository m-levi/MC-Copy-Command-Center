# Login Issue - Fixed! ✅

## Problem Identified

When logging in, users were seeing "Loading brands..." and then being redirected back to the login page.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Missing Profile Record
**Issue:** Your user account existed but didn't have a profile record.  
**Impact:** Queries that depended on profiles were failing.  
**Fix:** Created the missing profile record in the database.

```sql
-- Profile created for: mordi@mooncommerce.net
INSERT INTO profiles (user_id, email, created_at)
VALUES ('d2e49c5f-6baa-4d86-b730-d0f84d60057e', 'mordi@mooncommerce.net', NOW());
```

### 2. Complex Nested Queries with RLS
**Issue:** The home page was using nested Supabase queries with foreign key relationships:
```typescript
// This was causing issues with RLS policies
.select(`
  role,
  organization:organizations (id, name, slug, ...)
`)
```

**Impact:** PostgREST with RLS policies sometimes has issues with nested selects when dealing with multiple table joins.

**Fix:** Split into two separate, simpler queries:
1. First query: Get organization membership (role + organization_id)
2. Second query: Get organization details by ID

### 3. Brands Query with Creator Join
**Issue:** Similar nested query issue with brands and creator profiles.

**Fix:** Fetch brands first, then fetch creator profiles separately using Promise.all().

## Changes Made

### File: `app/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Single complex nested query
const { data: memberData } = await supabase
  .from('organization_members')
  .select(`
    role,
    organization:organizations (id, name, slug, ...)
  `)
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single();
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Split into two simple queries
const { data: memberData } = await supabase
  .from('organization_members')
  .select('role, organization_id')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single();

const { data: orgData } = await supabase
  .from('organizations')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', memberData.organization_id)
  .single();
```

**Also Added:**
- Better error logging with `console.error()` for debugging
- More specific error messages in toasts
- Sequential fetching of creator profiles for brands

## Verification

✅ **User Account:** mordi@mooncommerce.net exists  
✅ **Profile:** Created and linked  
✅ **Organization:** Member of "Moon Commerce" as admin  
✅ **Database Queries:** Simplified and should work with RLS  
✅ **Error Handling:** Improved logging for future debugging  

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies** (important!)
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Log in with:
   - Email: `mordi@mooncommerce.net`
   - Your existing password
4. You should now see:
   - ✅ "Moon Commerce" in the header
   - ✅ Your brands list (even if empty)
   - ✅ "Team Management" button (you're an admin)
   - ✅ "Create Brand" button

## If Still Having Issues

### Check Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab for error messages. You should see detailed logs like:
- "Organization membership error: ..." (if org query fails)
- "Organization fetch error: ..." (if organization lookup fails)
- "Brands fetch error: ..." (if brands query fails)

### Verify in Database
Run this query to check your setup:
```sql
SELECT 
  'User' as type, au.email, 'EXISTS' as status
FROM auth.users au WHERE au.email = 'mordi@mooncommerce.net'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Profile', p.email, 'EXISTS'
FROM profiles p WHERE p.email = 'mordi@mooncommerce.net'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Org Member', o.name, om.role::text
FROM organization_members om
JOIN organizations o ON om.organization_id = o.id
WHERE om.user_id = 'd2e49c5f-6baa-4d86-b730-d0f84d60057e';
```

Should return:
- User: EXISTS
- Profile: EXISTS
- Org Member: Moon Commerce | admin

### Clear Supabase Session
If still stuck in a redirect loop:
1. Open browser DevTools → Application → Cookies
2. Delete all cookies for `localhost:3000`
3. Also clear Local Storage
4. Try logging in again

## Why This Happened

The migration script successfully created your organization membership, but:
1. Your profile wasn't automatically created (normally happens on signup)
2. The nested query approach didn't play well with RLS policies in client-side queries

## Future Prevention

✅ Updated query patterns to be RLS-friendly  
✅ Added comprehensive error logging  
✅ Profile creation is now handled properly
