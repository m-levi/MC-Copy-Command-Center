# Email Flow Builder - UX Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Progress Indication During Email Generation

**Problem**: No visual feedback when generating emails - felt choppy and uncertain.

**Solution**:
- Created `FlowGenerationProgress` component with beautiful modal
- Shows current email being generated (Email 1 of 3, Email 2 of 3, etc.)
- Progress bar with percentage
- List of all emails with checkmarks for completed ones
- Estimated time remaining
- Smooth animations

**Implementation**:
- New component: `components/FlowGenerationProgress.tsx`
- Added state: `isGeneratingFlow`, `flowGenerationProgress`
- Updates every 5 seconds during generation
- Full-screen modal with backdrop blur

### 2. ‚úÖ Child Conversations Hidden from Main Sidebar

**Problem**: Sidebar cluttered with individual flow emails - confusing to see them separate from parent.

**Solution**:
- Filtered out all child conversations from main sidebar list
- Only parent flow conversations appear in sidebar
- Children are accessed via FlowOutlineDisplay within the parent conversation
- Much cleaner organization

**Implementation**:
- Filter applied: `!conv.parent_conversation_id`
- Children only shown when viewing parent flow
- Cleaner sidebar navigation

### 3. ‚úÖ Flow Type Displayed on Parent Conversation

**Problem**: No visual indication of what type of flow it is in sidebar.

**Solution**:
- Added flow type display in conversation card
- Shows icon + flow type name (e.g., "Abandoned Cart", "Welcome Series")
- Appears below title for flow conversations
- Clear visual differentiation

**Implementation**:
- Updated `ConversationCard.tsx`
- Shows flow type when `conversation.is_flow === true`
- Properly formatted flow type names

### 4. ‚úÖ Standard Email Format for Flow Emails

**Problem**: Flow emails weren't using the standard EMAIL SUBJECT LINE / HERO SECTION / etc. format.

**Solution**:
- Updated flow email prompt to use EXACT standard format
- Enforces same structure as regular emails:
  - EMAIL SUBJECT LINE:
  - PREVIEW TEXT:
  - HERO SECTION:
  - SECTION 1-N:
  - CALL-TO-ACTION SECTION:
  - DESIGN NOTES:
- Now displays perfectly in EmailPreview and sections view

**Implementation**:
- Modified `lib/flow-prompts.ts` ‚Üí `buildFlowEmailPrompt()`
- Added explicit format instructions
- Emails now parse and display identically to regular emails

### 5. ‚úÖ Flow Badge in Sidebar

**Problem**: Flows looked like regular conversations in sidebar.

**Solution**:
- Flow conversations now show "üîÑ Flow" badge instead of "üìã Plan" or "‚úâÔ∏è Write"
- Instantly recognizable as a flow
- Consistent with existing badge system

**Implementation**:
- Updated `ConversationCard.tsx` mode badge logic
- Checks `conversation.is_flow` first
