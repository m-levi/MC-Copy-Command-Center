# 🔍 Product Search & Linking Feature (Updated)

## Overview

Your AI email copywriter now automatically finds and includes product links when mentioning products in email campaigns using **AI native web search**!

## ✨ What's New

The feature now uses **Claude and OpenAI's built-in web search capabilities** instead of external APIs:
- ✅ **No Google API required** - Uses AI native search
- ✅ **More intelligent** - AI understands context better
- ✅ **Real-time information** - AI can search current product details
- ✅ **Zero additional cost** - Included with your AI API usage
- ✅ **Simpler setup** - Just add website URL to your brands

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **You add website URL** to your brand settings
2. **AI writes email** mentioning products (e.g., "Winter Collection")
3. **AI can search** the website if it needs current product info (optional)
4. **Product links appear** automatically at the end of the message
5. **URLs are constructed** based on detected product names

## 🚀 Quick Setup (2 Steps!)

### Step 1: Database Migration ✅ COMPLETE
Already applied via Supabase MCP! The `website_url` column has been added to the brands table.

### Step 2: Add Website URL (30 seconds)
1. Edit your brand
2. Fill in "Website URL" field (e.g., `https://www.yourbrand.com`)
3. Save

**That's it!** You're ready to use the feature.

## 💡 How AI Native Search Works

### When AI Needs Product Details

If the AI mentions a product and needs current information (like descriptions, availability, pricing), it can search your website directly:

**Example Prompt:**
```
"Write an email about our Winter Sale featuring current products"
```

**What Happens:**
1. AI generates email copy
2. If AI needs info, it can search your website
3. AI mentions products naturally (e.g., "Cozy Wool Sweater")
4. System detects product mentions
5. Product links appear automatically

### Product URL Construction

For product links, the system:
1. Extracts product names from AI response
2. Creates URLs using common e-commerce patterns:
   - `/products/product-name-slug`
   - `/shop/product-name-slug`
   - `/product/product-name-slug`

## 📦 Example

**You Ask:**
```
"Write a promotional email for our Winter Sale featuring our bestsellers"
```

**AI Response:**
```
EMAIL SUBJECT LINE:
Winter Warmth: Save 30% on Bestsellers

[... email content mentioning "Cozy Wool Sweater" and "Thermal Leggings" ...]
```

**You Get:**
```
[Email Copy Display]
