# 🤖 Automatic Memory System - Complete Guide

## ✅ Confirmed: Both Manual AND Automatic Memory

Your memory system now works in **two ways**:

### 1. 👤 Manual Memory (User-Controlled)
Users can click the Memory button and manually add/edit/delete memories through the beautiful UI.

### 2. 🤖 Automatic Memory (AI-Controlled)
The AI automatically saves important information as it learns during conversations.

## 🧠 How Automatic Memory Works

### AI Instructions
Both Claude and GPT-5 are now instructed to save memories using a special syntax that's **invisible to users**:

```
[REMEMBER:key_name=value:category]
```

### Example Conversation

**User:** "I prefer a casual, friendly tone for all my emails"

**AI Response (what user sees):**
```
"Got it! I'll use a casual and friendly tone for your emails. 
This will help create a more approachable connection with your audience."
```

**Behind the scenes (automatic memory save):**
```
[REMEMBER:tone_preference=casual and friendly:user_preference]
```

**Next message from user:** "Create an email about our summer sale"

**AI automatically:**
1. Loads memory: `tone_preference = "casual and friendly"`
2. Uses casual tone without being told again
3. Creates consistent brand voice

## 📊 Memory Categories

The AI can automatically categorize memories:

### 👤 user_preference
Personal preferences learned from the conversation:
```
[REMEMBER:tone_preference=professional and authoritative:user_preference]
[REMEMBER:email_length=short and punchy:user_preference]
[REMEMBER:cta_style=direct action verbs:user_preference]
```

### 🎨 brand_context
Brand information discovered:
```
[REMEMBER:target_audience=tech-savvy millennials:brand_context]
[REMEMBER:price_point=premium luxury:brand_context]
[REMEMBER:brand_personality=innovative and bold:brand_context]
```

### 📊 campaign_info
Campaign-specific details:
```
[REMEMBER:campaign_goal=increase Q4 revenue by 20%:campaign_info]
[REMEMBER:promo_code=FALL2024:campaign_info]
[REMEMBER:email_sequence=5-part welcome series:campaign_info]
```

### 🛍️ product_details
Product information learned:
```
[REMEMBER:bestseller=wireless headphones model XH-200:product_details]
[REMEMBER:new_launch=smartwatch launching March 2025:product_details]
[REMEMBER:price_drop=winter coats now 40% off:product_details]
```

### ✅ decision
Strategic decisions made:
```
[REMEMBER:chosen_approach=storytelling over feature listing:decision]
[REMEMBER:email_frequency=twice weekly on Tues and Fri:decision]
[REMEMBER:avoided_strategy=aggressive discounting:decision]
```

### 📝 fact
Important facts to remember:
```
[REMEMBER:seasonal_promo=free shipping through December:fact]
[REMEMBER:customer_feedback=customers love fast delivery:fact]
[REMEMBER:competitor_insight=competitor prices 15% higher:fact]
```

## 🔄 Real-World Example Flow

### Conversation 1:
```
User: "Our target audience is busy professionals who value quality"
AI: "Perfect! I'll keep that in mind for all your campaigns."
     [REMEMBER:target_audience=busy professionals valuing quality:brand_context]

User: "I like emails that get straight to the point"
AI: "Got it - concise, direct communication works best."
     [REMEMBER:email_style=concise and direct:user_preference]
```

### Conversation 2 (Same Day):
```
User: "Write an email about our new product line"
AI: *Automatically loads memories and sees:*
     - target_audience = busy professionals valuing quality
     - email_style = concise and direct
     
     *Creates email accordingly without being reminded*
```

### Conversation 3 (Next Week):
```
User: "Create a promotional email"
AI: *Still remembers everything and maintains consistency*
```

## 🎯 When Does AI Save Memories?

The AI automatically saves when it learns:

### ✅ User Preferences:
- "I prefer X tone"
- "Keep it short"
- "Use action-oriented CTAs"
- "No emojis in subject lines"

### ✅ Strategic Decisions:
- "Let's focus on benefits over features"
- "We'll avoid mentioning competitors"
- "Target price-conscious shoppers"

### ✅ Important Facts:
- "We have a 15% discount code"
- "Free shipping on orders over $50"
- "Our bestseller is the blue widget"

### ✅ Brand Context:
- "Our audience is Gen Z"
- "We're a premium brand"
- "Sustainability is core to our message"

### ❌ Does NOT Save:
- One-time requests
- Temporary information
- Already-known facts
- Trivial details

## 🔍 How to See Auto-Saved Memories

### Check Console Logs:
```
[OpenAI] Found 2 memory instructions
[Memory] Saved: tone_preference = casual and friendly
[Memory] Saved: target_audience = millennials
```

### Check Memory UI:
1. Click Memory button (💡)
2. See all memories (manual + auto-saved)
3. Edit or delete any memory
4. Add additional manual memories

### Check Database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM conversation_memories 
WHERE conversation_id = 'your-conversation-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## 🎨 Memory Format (Technical)

### Syntax:
```
[REMEMBER:key=value:category]
```

### Rules:
- **key**: snake_case identifier (e.g., `tone_preference`)
- **value**: any text (e.g., `casual and friendly`)
- **category**: one of 6 categories
- **Invisible**: Markers are stripped from user-visible response
- **Automatic**: System parses after streaming completes

### Multiple Memories:
```
[REMEMBER:tone=casual:user_preference]
[REMEMBER:audience=millennials:brand_context]
[REMEMBER:promo=SAVE20:campaign_info]
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Protected:
- ✅ Only saved for current conversation
- ✅ RLS policies enforce access control
- ✅ No cross-conversation leaks
- ✅ Organization boundaries respected

### User Control:
- ✅ View all memories (auto + manual)
- ✅ Edit any memory
- ✅ Delete any memory
- ✅ Full transparency

## 📈 Benefits of Automatic Memory

### For Users:
1. **No Repetition**: Never re-explain preferences
2. **Consistency**: AI maintains consistent brand voice
3. **Efficiency**: Faster conversations
4. **Personalization**: AI adapts to your style

### For AI:
1. **Context**: Better understanding of requirements
2. **Accuracy**: Remembers specific details
3. **Consistency**: Makes aligned decisions
4. **Learning**: Improves over time

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For AI (Built-in):
1. ✅ Save preferences when explicitly stated
2. ✅ Save important decisions
3. ✅ Save brand context as learned
4. ✅ Use clear, descriptive keys
5. ✅ Categorize appropriately

### For Users:
1. ✅ Review memories periodically
2. ✅ Update outdated information
3. ✅ Delete temporary memories
4. ✅ Add manual memories for quick reference

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Optional Expiration:
Memories can have expiration dates (set manually in UI):
```typescript
// Manual memory with 30-day expiration
await saveMemory(
  conversationId,
  'seasonal_promo',
  'Free shipping for holiday season',
  'campaign_info',
  30 // expires in 30 days
);
```

### Memory Updates:
If AI saves same key twice, it updates (not duplicates):
```
First: [REMEMBER:tone=casual:user_preference]
Later: [REMEMBER:tone=professional:user_preference]
Result: tone is updated to "professional"
```

### Cross-Model Compatibility:
Memories work identically with both Claude and GPT-5:
```
Claude saves:  [REMEMBER:audience=millennials:brand_context]
GPT-5 loads:   audience = millennials
GPT-5 saves:   [REMEMBER:tone=casual:user_preference]
Claude loads:  tone = casual
```
