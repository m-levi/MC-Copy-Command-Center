# Planning Mode V2 - Quick Start Guide

## What Changed?

Planning Mode is now a **true planning and strategy tool** - it won't accidentally write your email for you anymore. It's designed to help you think through your campaign step-by-step.

## 3 Simple Rules

1. **Planning Mode** = Ask questions, discuss strategy, create outlines
2. **Email Copy Mode** = Generate actual email copy
3. **Transfer Plan** = Move from planning to copy with full context

## Quick Start

### Option A: Start with Planning (Recommended)

1. **Create new conversation** - defaults to Planning Mode
2. **Share your idea**: "I want to create a promotional email for..."
3. **Answer the AI's questions** about audience, goals, offer
4. **Watch the stage indicator** progress through Discovery → Strategy → Ready
5. **Click "Transfer Plan"** when you see the green checkmark
6. **Review the brief** and send to generate your email

### Option B: Skip to Email Copy

1. **Create new conversation**
2. **Click Email Copy mode** in the header toggle
3. **Describe your email**: "Create a [type] email for [purpose]..."
4. **AI generates** complete email immediately

### Example Planning Conversation:

**You**: "I need an email for our summer sale"

**AI**: "Let me help you plan this! A few questions:
- Who is this targeting?
- What's the discount?
- Any deadline or urgency?"

**You**: "Existing customers, 30% off, ends Sunday"

**AI**: "Perfect! Strategic recommendations:

Approach 1: Urgency-first (deadline in hero)
Approach 2: Value-first (products in hero)

Suggested Outline:
- Hero: Weekend sale + deadline
- Section 1: Featured products
- Section 2: Why shop now
- CTA: Shop the sale

Which approach fits better?"
