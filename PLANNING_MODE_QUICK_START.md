# Planning Mode - Quick Start Guide

## Setup (One-Time)

Run this SQL migration in your Supabase SQL Editor:

-- Add mode column to conversations table
ALTER TABLE conversations 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS mode TEXT CHECK (mode IN ('planning', 'email_copy')) DEFAULT 'planning';

-- Update existing conversations
UPDATE conversations 
SET mode = CASE 
  WHEN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM messages WHERE messages.conversation_id = conversations.id
  ) THEN 'email_copy'
  ELSE 'planning'
END
WHERE mode IS NULL;
```

    3. Value Reminders: ...

      Can we try a softer approach?

    gentler incentive strategy...
