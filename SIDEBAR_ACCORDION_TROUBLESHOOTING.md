# Sidebar Accordion Troubleshooting

## If You Don't See the Accordion in Sidebar

### Quick Fixes to Try:

1. **Hard Refresh the Browser**
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
   - This clears cached JavaScript

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for logs like: `[ConversationCard] Loading children for flow`
   - Should see: `[ConversationCard] Loaded X children for flow`

3. **Verify You Have a Flow Conversation**
   - The accordion only shows for flow conversations
   - Look for conversations with "🔄 Flow" badge
   - If you don't have any flows yet, create one first

4. **Check if Flow Has Children**
   - Accordion will show "No emails generated yet" if flow exists but hasn't been approved
   - You need to approve an outline for children to exist

### How to Test:

1. **Create a new flow:**
   - In WRITE mode, click dropdown → Select "Flow"
   - Choose any flow type (e.g., "Abandoned Cart")
   - Build and approve an outline
   - Generate the emails

2. **Check sidebar:**
   - Find the flow conversation (will have "🔄 Flow" badge)
   - Look for small arrow button next to flow type name
   - Click the arrow
   - Should expand to show child emails

### What You Should See:

**Before Expansion:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔄 Flow                         │
│ New Abandoned Cart Flow      ▶ │  ← Arrow button
│ 🛒 Abandoned Cart               │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**After Expansion (if children exist):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔄 Flow                         │
│ New Abandoned Cart Flow      ▼ │  ← Arrow rotated
│ 🛒 Abandoned Cart               │
│   ├─ #1 Reminder Email →       │  ← Child emails
│   ├─ #2 Objections Email →     │
│   └─ #3 Final Offer →          │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Debug Checks:

**1. Check if conversation is marked as flow:**
```javascript
// In browser console
// Should show is_flow: true for flow conversations
```

**2. Check if children exist in database:**
- Go to Supabase dashboard
- SQL Editor
- Run: 
```sql
SELECT id, title, parent_conversation_id, flow_sequence_order, flow_email_title
FROM conversations 
WHERE parent_conversation_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY parent_conversation_id, flow_sequence_order;
```

**3. Check console for loading logs:**
- Look for: `[ConversationCard] Loading children for flow:`
- Look for: `[ConversationCard] Loaded X children`

### Common Issues:

**Arrow button not visible:**
- Check that conversation has `is_flow: true`
- The arrow only shows when `conversation.is_flow` is true
- Look for the flow type name (e.g., "Abandoned Cart")

**Arrow visible but nothing expands:**
- Check console for errors
- Verify children exist in database
- Should show "No emails generated yet" if no children

**Children exist but don't display:**
- Check that `onSelectChild` prop is being passed
- Verify `currentConversationId` is passed to ConversationCard
- Check browser console for errors

### Force Reload:

If nothing works:
1. Stop the dev server
2. Delete `.next` folder
3. Restart: `npm run dev`
4. Hard refresh browser

## Current Implementation

The accordion is implemented in `components/ConversationCard.tsx`:

- **Lines 176-204**: Flow info section with expand button
- **Lines 31-71**: State management and child loading logic
- **Lines 314-368**: Child emails rendering with accordion

The feature is **definitely implemented** - if you're not seeing it, it's likely a caching issue or you need to create a flow first.
