# ✅ Post-Migration Testing Checklist

Use this after running `FLOW_DATABASE_MIGRATION.sql`

---

## 🔍 Phase 1: Database Verification (2 min)

### Test 1: Columns Exist
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'conversations' 
AND column_name IN ('is_flow', 'parent_conversation_id', 'flow_type', 'flow_sequence_order', 'flow_email_title');
```

- [ ] Returns 5 rows
- [ ] All types correct (boolean, uuid, text, integer, text)

### Test 2: Table Exists
```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
  WHERE table_name = 'flow_outlines'
);
```

- [ ] Returns `true`

### Test 3: Indexes Created
```sql
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'conversations' 
AND indexname LIKE '%flow%';
```

- [ ] At least 3 indexes returned

---

## 📋 Database Verification (Optional)

### Check Created Data

ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

- [ ] Shows your flow with `is_flow = true`
- [ ] Has correct `flow_type`

```sql
-- View children
SELECT id, title, parent_conversation_id, flow_sequence_order, flow_email_title
FROM conversations
WHERE parent_conversation_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY parent_conversation_id, flow_sequence_order;
```

- [ ] Shows all child emails
- [ ] Each has `parent_conversation_id` set
- [ ] `flow_sequence_order` is 1, 2, 3, etc.
- [ ] `flow_email_title` has descriptive titles

```sql
-- View outline
SELECT * FROM flow_outlines ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

- [ ] Outline saved with correct data
