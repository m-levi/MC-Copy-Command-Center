## 🎯 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Run this SQL in your [Supabase SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/swmijewkwwsbbccfzexe/sql/new):

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire AUTH_SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.sql file
```

**OR** use the command line:

# The migration has already been applied via Supabase MCP!
# Check your database to verify the new tables exist
```

### Step 2: Enable Security Features in Supabase Dashboard

## 📝 Common Tasks

### Reset a Locked Account (Admin)

  failed_login_attempts = 0
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### View User's Security Log
```sql
SELECT * FROM security_audit_log
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### List Active Sessions
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  s.device_info,
  s.ip_address,
  s.last_activity
FROM user_sessions s
JOIN auth.users u ON s.user_id = u.id
WHERE s.last_activity > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY s.last_activity DESC;
```

### Clean Up Old Data
```sql
SELECT cleanup_expired_sessions();
-- Removes sessions older than 30 days
-- Removes audit logs older than 90 days
```
