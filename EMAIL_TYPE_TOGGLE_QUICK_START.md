## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Switch to Write Mode
Click the **WRITE** button in the chat interface.

### Step 2: Choose Your Email Type
You'll see a toggle next to the model picker:

```
[PLAN] [WRITE]  [SONNET 4.5 ▼]  [DESIGN] [LETTER]
                                   ↑
                           Select email type here
```

- **DESIGN** is selected by default
- Click **LETTER** to switch to letter-style emails

### Step 3: Generate Your Email

#### For Design Emails:
Just describe what you want:
```
"Create a flash sale email for our new summer collection with 40% off"
```

AI generates a full structured email with:
- Subject line and preview text
- Hero section with headline and CTA
- Body sections with product details
- Final CTA section
- Design notes

#### For Letter Emails:
Describe your need:
```
"Write a thank you email to a customer who just made their first purchase"
```

AI will first ask you:
- Who is this from? (e.g., "Sarah from [Brand]")
- Who is it to? (e.g., customer's name or "our customers")
- What's the purpose?
- Key message or offer?
- Tone preference?

Then provides a personal letter like:
```
SUBJECT: Thanks for your first order, Emma!
