# ✅ Complete Update Summary - Smart UI & Formatting Fixes

## Overview

Two related improvements have been implemented to make the app feel smarter and more polished:

1. **Smart UI Behavior** - Hide tool usage narration
2. **Formatting Fix** - Clean up stray brackets and whitespace

---

## 🎯 Issue #1: Smart UI Behavior

### Problem
When the AI used tools (web search, URL fetching, memory storage), it announced what it was doing in the chat response, making it feel robotic:

```
❌ "I'll fetch the details about this product..."
❌ https://example.com/url-being-fetched
❌ "Perfect! I have all the details..."
❌ [REMEMBER:key=value:category]
```

### Solution
- Updated all AI prompts with "SMART UI BEHAVIOR" instructions
- Enhanced stream cleaning to remove `[REMEMBER:...]` tags
- Tool usage now appears in thinking/activity indicator only

### Result
```
✅ Activity Indicator: "Thinking → Analyzing → Crafting"
✅ Thinking Panel (optional): Full tool usage details
✅ Chat Response: Clean, professional email copy only
```

---

## 🔧 Issue #2: Formatting Problems

### Problem
Email content displayed with:
- Stray closing brackets `]` at the end
- Excessive whitespace
- Marker remnants after cleaning

```
... content ...

]  ← This shouldn't be here!
```

### Solution
Enhanced stream finalization with comprehensive cleanup:
- Removes stray brackets at end
- Cleans trailing marker remnants
- Normalizes excessive whitespace

### Result
```
✅ Clean, formatted output
✅ No stray characters
✅ Professional appearance
```

## 💡 Key Improvements

### 1. Smarter Appearance
The app now feels intelligent, not robotic. Tool usage is seamless and invisible to users who don't need to see the mechanics.

### 2. Cleaner Output
No more formatting glitches, stray characters, or marker remnants. Every response is polished and professional.

### 3. Better UX
Users focus on results, not process. Optional deep-dive into thinking panel for power users.

### 4. Maintainability
